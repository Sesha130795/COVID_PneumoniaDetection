Multiclass classficiation of dataset obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prashant268/chest-xray-covid19-pneumonia/code?dThis is my first project in the field of AI i Diagnostic Imaging. Being a total noobster I have tried my best to run a classficiation model for classifiying COVID19, Pneumonia and a normal lung x ray. This notebook goes through a transfer learning process using the resnet 18 architecture The results are compared by changing the hyperparameters learning rate and layers of the model. A training accuracy of around 94% and validation accuracy of around 93.5% was achieved.
